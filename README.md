# Extraction-and-Analysis-of-Character-Interaction-in-Oppenheimer

This project attempts to conduct a Computational Analysis of Character Relationships and Linguistic Patterns in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. 

It combines techniques in Natural Language processing and Network analysis, first to extract data that will form the nodes and edges, a critical part of netwrok analysis, and secondly to show the patterns in character interactions.
